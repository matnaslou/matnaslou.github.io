<h2>Welcome to My Blog!</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences as a Master's student
    in Economics.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as a space where I can:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Share insights from my research journey</li>
    <li>Discuss interesting economic concepts and their real-world applications</li>
    <li>Provide tips on data analysis and research methodology</li>
    <li>Reflect on academic life and career development</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Expect</h3>

<p>I plan to write about a variety of topics that intersect with my academic interests. Whether you're a fellow
    researcher, a student considering graduate school, or simply curious about economics, I hope you'll find something
    valuable here.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Economics is the study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity and the impact of those choices on
    society."

    topics you'd like me to cover!</p>
